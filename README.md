# my-scripts

This is the repository for 201

This repository contains both bash scripts and powershell scripts.

I learned to write in Bash and PowerShell in order to become more proficient in coding in both.

I learned Hello World, loops, and conditionals.

I don't really have a favorite, but the closest one would be challenge nine as it was the most straight forward.

Scripts that show a computer's details and locate files can be really efficient in the workplace.

Probably my scripts in Bash.

I would like to improve my skillsets in bash.
